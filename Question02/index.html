      <h2>Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b>
        <br>
        Jean Piaget, a Swiss psychologist, formulated a pioneering theory on how children's thinking evolves as they grow. His theory explains cognitive development through stages, showcasing how children learn and adapt.
        <br>
        
        <b>Key Concepts</b><br>
        Children develop mental frameworks called schemas to organize and interpret information. Schemas help them understand the world by fitting new experiences into existing knowledge.
        <br><br>
        <b>Assimilation and Accommodation</b>
        Children assimilate new information into their schemas and accommodate by adjusting or forming new schemas when faced with conflicting data.
        <br>
        <b>Equilibration</b><br>
        Cognitive development is driven by equilibration, a balance between assimilation and accommodation, maintaining cognitive harmony.
        <br>
        <b>Stages of Development</b><br>
        Piaget identified four stages:
        <br>
        <b>1. Sensorimotor Stage (Birth to 2 Years)</b><br>
        Infants explore through senses, developing object permanence and symbolic thinking.
        <br>
        <b>2. Preoperational Stage (2 to 7 Years)</b><br>
        Children use symbols and language to represent, but struggle with perspective-taking and centration.
        <br>
        <b>3. Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 11 Years)</b><br>
        Logical thinking emerges, including conservation and decentration abilities.
        <br>
       <b>4. Formal Operational Stage (11 Years and Beyond)</b><br>
        Abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning develop.
        <br>
        <b>Criticisms</b><br>
        Piaget's theory faces criticism for oversimplification, cultural variations, and individual differences in development.
        <br>
        <b>Conclusion</b><br>
        Piaget's theory revolutionized understanding of cognitive development. While not flawless, it remains a foundational framework for comprehending how children learn and mature cognitively.</p>
