      <h2>About the Royal Bengal Tiger</h2>
      <p>
        <u><b>Bengal tiger</b></u> <br>
        The Bengal tiger is a population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies and the nominate tiger subspecies. It ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today.
        <br>
        <u><b>Body weight and size</b></u> <br>
        It is considered to belong to the world's charismatic megafauna.Males and female Bengal tigers in Panna Tiger Reserve reach a head-to-body length of 183–211 cm (72–83 in) and 164–193 cm (65–76 in) respectively, including a tail about 85–110 cm (33–43 in) long. Total length ranges from 283 to 311 cm (111 to 122 in) for male tigers and 255–285 cm (100–112 in) for female tigers.[23] They typically range from 90–110 cm (35–43 in) in shoulder height.[24]

        Subadult males weigh between 130 and 170 kg (290 and 370 lb) and reach 200 to 260 kg (440 to 570 lb) when adult; subadult females weigh 80 to 100 kg (180 to 220 lb) and reach between 110 and 180 kg (240 and 400 lb) when adult.[25] In central India, 42 adult male Bengal tigers weighed on average 190 kg (420 lb) with a range of 167–234 kg (368–516 lb); their total length was 282 cm (111 in) with a range of 267–312 cm (105–123 in), and their average shoulder height was 99 cm (39 in); 39 adult female Bengal tigers weighed an average of 132 kg (291 lb) with a maximum of 156 kg (344 lb) and an average total length of 254 cm (100 in) ranging from 239 to 277 cm (94 to 109 in).[26] Several scientists indicated that adult male Bengal tigers in the Terai consistently attain more than 227 kg (500 lb) of body weight. Seven adult males captured in Chitwan National Park in the early 1970s had an average weight of 235 kg (518 lb) ranging from 200 to 261 kg (441 to 575 lb), and that of the females was 140 kg (310 lb) ranging from 116 to 164 kg (256 to 362 lb).[27] Two male tigers captured in Chitwan National Park in the 1980s exceeded weights of 270 kg (600 lb) and are the largest free ranging tigers reported to date.[28]
        
        The smallest recorded weights for Bengal tigers are from the Bangladesh Sundarbans, where adult females weigh 75 to 80 kg (165 to 176 lb).[29] Three tigresses from the Bangladesh Sundarbans had a mean weight of 76.7 kg (169 lb). The oldest female weighed 75 kg (165 lb) and was in a relatively poor condition at the time of capture. Their skulls and body weights were distinct from those of tigers in other habitats, indicating that they may have adapted to the unique conditions of the mangrove habitat. Their small sizes are probably due to a combination of intense intraspecific competition and small size of prey available to tigers in the Sundarbans, compared to the larger deer and other prey available to tigers in other parts.[30]
        
        The very large "Leeds Tiger" on display at Leeds City Museum, shot in 1860 near Mussoorie, had a body length of 371 cm (12 ft 2 in) at death. Two tigers shot in Kumaon District and near Oude at the end of the 19th century allegedly measured more than 370 cm (12 ft). But at the time, sportsmen had not yet adopted a standard system of measurement; some measured 'between the pegs' while others measured 'over the curves'.[31] The greatest length of a tiger skull measured 413 mm (16.25 in) "over the bone"; this one was shot in the vicinity of Nagina in northern India.[32]
        
        In the beginning of the 20th century, a male tiger was shot in central India with a head and body length of 221 cm (87 in) between pegs, a chest girth of 150 cm (59 in), a shoulder height of 109 cm (43 in) and a tail length of 81 cm (32 in), which was perhaps bitten off by a rival male. This specimen could not be weighed, but it was estimated to weigh about 272 kg (600 lb).[26] A male weighing 259 kg (570 lb) was shot in northern India in the 1930s.[32] A male tiger shot in Nepal weighed 320 kg (710 lb) and measured 328 cm (10 ft 9 in) 'over the curves'.[33] The heaviest wild tiger was possibly a huge male killed in 1967 at the foothills of the Himalayas. It weighed 388.7 kg (857 lb) after eating a buffalo calf; it measured 323 cm (127 in) in total length between pegs, and 338 cm (133 in) over curves. Without eating the calf beforehand, it would have likely weighed at least 324.3 kg (715 lb). This specimen is on exhibition in the Mammals Hall of the Smithsonian Institution.[34] In the Central Provinces of India, a male tiger shot weighed 317 kg (699 lb) and measured 3.02 m (9 ft 11 in).[35]
        
        The Bengal tiger rivals the Siberian tiger in average weight.[36]
